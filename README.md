# jahanavi-sinha-islandsOfHexProject
Model-View-Controller (MVC) for Islands of Hex - 2 player game with the goal of having the most islands on the board.
An island = a connected group of similarly colored game pieces that are surrounded by either empty tiles or tiles occupied by the opposite color. 
It is a two player game with one player playing white game pieces and the other playing black game pieces. 

This was created in my fundamentals of computer science 2 course in my spring 2024 semester at Northeastern University with starter code provided by my professor.
